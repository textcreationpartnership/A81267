            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He firſt duty I ſhall minde, is, that they are to feed the flock of God, as you ſhall finde a Rule for ſo doing, even a Command, in <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28, 29, 30. where it is thus ſaid, <hi>Take heed unto your ſelves, and to all the flock over which the holy Spirit hath made you overſeers, to feed the Church of God which he hath purchaſed with his own blood.</hi> And the reaſon why they ought to be ſo careful in taking heed, he ſheweth in the following verſes: <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I know this, that after my departing ſhall grievous wolves enter in among you, not ſparing the flock: alſo of your own ſelves ſhall men ariſe, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perverſe things, to draw away diſciples after them.</hi> And for this very cauſe, he layeth a more ſtrict charge on them to watch, leaving himſelf as an example, in theſe words: <hi>Watch therefore, and remember, that by the ſpace of three yeers I ceaſed not to warn every one, night and day, with tears.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O now conſider, To be warned beforehand, is as much as can be deſired: and now, if they that are Miniſters or El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders do not watch, they are left inexcuſable. Therefore let theſe conſiderations move all they that are intruſted in ſo good a work as to feed the flock of God, to be diligent in ſo doing:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe God hath made them Overſeers, and ſet them as Watchmen over a people.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe he hath ſuch a love to them, that he hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed them with his own blood.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe there will be ſuch that will come into the Church, as will not ſpare the flock.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Becauſe there ſhall ariſe ſuch out from among the Church.</p>
            <p n="5">And 5. Becauſe the Apoſtle hath left ſuch an example, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118505:4"/>
hath ſpoken of thoſe things ſo plainly, as in the words fore-mentioned, as alſo in many other places; God alſo pronounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a wo againſt them that are not faithful, as you may ſee plainly, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.1, 2. where he reproves and threatens, in theſe words: <hi>Wo be unto the pastors that deſtroy and ſcatter the ſheep of my paſture, ſaith the Lord: therefore thus ſaith the Lord God of Iſrael againſt the paſtors that feed my people, You have ſcattered my flock, and driven them away, and have not viſited them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I will viſit upon you the evil of your doings, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh then, what great care ought thoſe to have that are El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders! for it is a fearful thing to have the Lord againſt one: for when the day is come that he will execute vengeance, who ſhall be able to ſtand? <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.15, 16, 17. <hi>Seeing theſe things are ſo, what maner of perſons ought ſuch to be?</hi> 2 Pet. 3.10, 11, 12. Seeing we have ſo many Woes pronounced by God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſhepherds that do not feed the flock, what care and faithfulneſs!</p>
            <p>You may be pleaſed to take notice of another Scripture, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. from verſ. 2. to 11. in theſe words: <hi>Propheſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſhepherds of Iſrael, and ſay unto them, Thus ſaith the Lord God unto the ſhepherds, Wo be unto them that do feed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: ſhould not the ſhepherds feed the flock?</hi> And ſheweth the reaſon why the flock was ſcattered, there was no ſhepherd to look after them, as will appear in verſ. 8. <hi>they feed themſelves, and not the flock.</hi> And in the tenth verſe he ſaith he is <hi>againſt them,</hi> ſo as they ſhall not feed themſelves nor the flock.</p>
            <p>What will become of ſuch as God is againſt, and do his work deceitfully? Of all men, they ſhall be curſed: <hi>for the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken.</hi> Jer. 48.10.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing you that are Elders are called to the work of the Lord, do not dare to leave your ſtation, for a more gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful place: do not idolize any thing, ſo as to ſet it up in your hearts, more then the Church of God, which Chriſt died for. Conſider that ſaying of the Lord in the Prophecie of <hi>Zecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah,</hi> chap. 11. verſ. 17. <hi>Wo to the idol-ſhepherd that leaveth the flock: the ſword ſhall be upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm ſhall be clean dried up, and his right eye ſhall be utterly d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:118505:4"/>
            <p>Oh then, take care of the flock; and, as commanded, feed, doing of it willingly, not having a by-end in ſo doing, as thoſe that are hirelings. They are alſo to behave themſelves hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2, 3. he that exhorts them being an Elder: the words being thus: <hi>Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the overſight thereof; not by conſtraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready minde: neither as being Lords over Gods heritage, but being enſamples to the flock.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And further, conſider <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. What a charge doth he alſo lay on <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.1, 2.3, 4, 5. <hi>I charge thee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, before God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing, and his kingdom: preach the Word, be inſtant in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon: reprove, rebuke, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort, with all long-ſuffering and doctrine.</hi> And ſheweth the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why; becauſe of the averſneſs of ſome that ſhould be in the Church of Chriſt: <hi>For,</hi> ſaith he, in verſ. 3. <hi>the time will come, they will not endure ſound doctrine, but after their own luſts ſhall heap to themſelves teachers, having itching ears. And they ſhall turn away their ears from the truth, and ſhall be turned unto fables. But watch thou in all things: endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy miniſtery. For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought the good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith.</hi> Here is excellent inſtruction; and a worthy patern was this Apoſtle.</p>
            <p>And he did give as good inſtruction to <hi>Titus,</hi> which is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of due conſideration. And, as hath been already ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they ought not, who are Shepherds, to leave the Church of Chriſt, no more then a woman her husband, though a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man cannot be kept by him. Nay further, ſhe ought not to be at a diſtance from him, without leave. If for poverty or lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving another, ſhe would leave her husband, then you may ſay ſhe is under a temptation; and leaving of him, that would be the part of an harlot.</p>
            <p>Oh then, I pray conſider of this, and ſee if it would not be ſo, if one that is made choice of by a Church, a people rightly ſtated, owning the Ordinances of God, to be an Elder
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118505:5"/>
and Overſeer to watch over them, if he ſhould for ſome great gain leave his people, then may one conclude, he is not onely under a temptation, but therein commits whoredom. It ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues no real love in ſuch a man, to deſert a people in the love of God, and in the ſtrength that God hath given them, keep the commandments of God: and ſuch ſhall abide in his love, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.10. By this you may ſee how ſhepherds ought to feed their flock.</p>
            <p>And let us further conſider the duty of Elders.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they muſt viſit the ſick, when ſent for, as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Is any ſick amongſt you? let him call for the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Such are to <hi>endure hardneſs, as good ſouldiers,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts <hi>Timothy</hi> to, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.3, 4. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.5. Such muſt <hi>give attendance to reading, that they may be able to divide the Word of truth aright, to convince all gainſayers,</hi> or at leaſt to maintain Truth againſt them; and this cannot be, except a ſearching of the Scriptures, <hi>which are able to make the man of God perfect:</hi> and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> chargeth <hi>Timothy</hi> to <hi>give at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance to reading,</hi> as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.13. And in the following verſes, he ſheweth him the benefit of ſo doing: for, ſaith he, <hi>in ſo doing, thou ſhalt both ſave thy ſelf, and them that hear thee,</hi> verſ. 16. Compare this with 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. where he ſaith, <hi>All Scripture is given by inſpiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for inſtruction in righteouſneſs; that the man of God may be perfect, thorowly furniſhed unto all
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118505:5"/>
good works.</hi> Take notice of this, I pray you, That this is the onely means, and that which is very beneficial; and ſo, ſuch that are Elders will come to be ſuch <hi>workmen as need not to be aſhamed;</hi> otherwiſe there may be an erring. Of all actions, do not omit ſearching the Scriptures. How ſhall men be able to appear before God, that cauſe the blinde to go out of the way? He ſhall be curſed, and fall with them that fall. <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.18. <hi>Curſed be he that maketh the blinde to wander out of the way. And the people ſhall ſay, Amen.</hi> If God did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all thoſe curſed, that did but direct any that were naturally blinde out of the way, how much ſorer puniſhment ſhall he be thought worthy of, that ſhall lead any to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal deſtruction? As our Lord ſaid, <hi>They ſhall both fall,</hi> Mat. 15.14. where the Lord ſpeaketh plainly of the ſpiritual blinde: our Lord therein prophetically ſpeaks of the downfal of thoſe that ſlighted the commands of God, and did obſerve the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of men: and all was for want of ſearching the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, or at leaſt for want of giving heed unto them. O then, let all them that are the true ſervants of Chriſt, and Elders of the Church of Chriſt, be warned and moved to ſearch the Scriptures; and in ſearching the Scriptures, they ſhall come to underſtand one duty more, and that is, how they that are Elders ought to be patterns and enſamples to their flocks, that they may ſay, <hi>Follow us.</hi> Therefore my exhortation is, once more, as <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.12. <hi>But be thou an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the believers, in word, in converſation, in charity, in ſpirit, in faith, in purity.</hi> And ſo walking, they will be meet inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to take care of thoſe that go aſtray: but if of a corrupt converſation, then not fit for ſo good a work, to tell others of their faults, when faulty; which will but diſhonour head and members; and what juſt cauſe of ſtumbling will be given thereby?

            <p>Such that are Shepherds, are not to hold falſe doctrines. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.14, 15. <hi>I have a few things againſt thee, becauſe thou haſt them that hold the doctrine of Balaam.</hi> And in verſ. 15. <hi>ſuch that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate,</hi> ſaith God.

They ſhould not be <hi>carried about with ſtrange do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,</hi> nor ſuffer their flocks. <hi>Paul</hi> writing to <hi>Titus,</hi> chap. 2.1. bid him <hi>ſpeak the things that become ſound doctrine.</hi> Chap. 1.9. <hi>holding faſt the faithful word, as he hath been taught; that he may be able by ſound doctrine, both to exhort and convince the gainſayers.</hi>

            <p>Laſtly, they ſhould <hi>work with their hands,</hi> as much as in them lies, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.34. <hi>Yea your ſelves know, that theſe hands have miniſtred to my neceſſities, and to them that were with me. I have ſhewed them all things, that in labouring you ought to ſupport the weak, and to remember the words of our Lord Jeſus, how he ſaid, It is more bleſſed to give then to receive.</hi> O that Elders would ſtop the mouths of enemies in ſo doing, and have no by-end in preaching. All that love God in ſincerity, will not be burdenſome to any; and if they can get a livelihood by their own lawful endeavours, they will ſay with the ſervants of God, <hi>Having food and rayment, let us therewith be contented.</hi> It is the minde of the true Miniſters of the Goſpel, ſo to enjoy earthly things, as not to ſee their brethren want, and not ſupply. How many of the ſo called Miniſters of the nation have ſo done? Not of the minde have they been of the ſervants of God in old times, that would not be chargeable.

            <p>Now that they that have begun in this work may proſper, and not be weary, great afflictions have attended the ſervants of God, muſt be confeſſed, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.4, 5, 6. O how did the ſervants and Miniſters of Chriſt approve themſelves, not in word onely, but in deed! in bitter afflictions, in perils and ſtripes, and the like. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.36, 37. If I ſhould ſpeak of others, it would be too tedious. None did ſuffer ſo as <hi>Paul,</hi> and none did ſo encourage. But for the encouragement of true ſhepherds, <hi>their ſufferings are not to be compared to the glory that ſhall be impoſed on them.</hi> 2 Cor. 4.17, 18. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo encourageth <hi>Timothy,</hi> chap. 4.8. <hi>A crown of righteouſneſs,</hi> not onely <hi>for him,</hi> but <hi>for all that love his appearing.</hi> Conſider, O ſhepherds, what the Lord ſaith to you, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.35, 36, 37. Take encouragement from the laſt words: <hi>Yet a little while, and he that ſhall come will come, and will not tarry.</hi> Heb. 12.2, 3. Conſider the practice of your Maſter; and conſider what is alſo ſaid, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8, 9. Shepherd, <hi>keep what is committed to you;</hi> and in ſo doing, you ſhall have <hi>great reward,</hi> Pſa. 19.11. Be of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s minde, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.25, 26. <hi>Chuſe rather to ſuffer afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Lords people, then to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> Rev. 22.12. Do not look for reward here, leſt it ſhould be ſaid as it was to the Scribes and Phariſees, doing what they did <hi>to be ſeen of men,</hi> they had here their reward, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.2. There is enough in God; look up, all true Miniſters, to him. If a great rich man on earth, will not let the favor and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his childe go unrewarded; what will Jeſus Chriſt do, in whom dwells all bowels! Be not idle, but <hi>up and doing,</hi> leſt you be cut aſunder. A glorious crown, a houſe not made with hands, will be the portion of thoſe that are faithful to the death. Let not pleaſures nor preferments, either by ſea or land, draw away your hearts, and cauſe you to leave the flocks of Chriſt: ſo much the more, becauſe he hath counted you worthy to know his minde, and to feed his flock. <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.15, 16. Conſider alſo that Scripture, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.4. which is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by way of encouragement. Doing their duties, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments in the hands of the eternal Spirit, to convert, they
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:118505:7"/>
ſhall <hi>ſhine at the ſtars in heaven,</hi> Dan. 12.3. Jam. 5.19, 20. Mat. 13.43. Many more Arguments I hope I need not uſe, there being others, I judge, in their breſts: and what hath been ſaid, calling upon God for a bleſſing, will ever engage true ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds to be true to their Maſter, King, Lord, and Saviour, and his people beloved of the Father.</p>
            <p>Having ſpoke without partiality to the duty of Miniſters, I ſhall now ſhew you the duty of people to their Elders: as firſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.7. and ſo on, where it is ſaid, <hi>Who goeth a warfare at any time of his own charge? who planteth a vineyard, and eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock? Say I theſe things as a man? ſaith not the Law the ſame alſo? For it is written in the law of Moſes, Thou ſhalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen? or ſaith he it altogether for our ſakes? For our ſakes no doubt this is written, that he that ploweth ſhould plow in hope, and that he that threſheth in hope, ſhould be partaker of his hope. If we have ſown unto you ſpiritual things, is it a great thing if we ſhall reap your carnal things? If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather? nevertheleſs we have not uſed this power, but ſuffer all things, lest we ſhould hinder the Goſpel of Christ. Do you not know, that they that miniſter about holy things, live of the things of the temple? and they that wait at the altar, are partakers with the altar? Even ſo hath the Lord or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, that they which preach the Goſpel ſhould live of the Goſpel. But I have not uſed theſe things,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.18. Gal. 6.6. <hi>Let him that is taught in the word, communicate to him that teacheth, in all good things.</hi> You ſee it is the duty of thoſe that are taught, to ſupport thoſe that teach. They are counted task-maſters, that will have work done, and will not allow of wherewithal. And all that do not do as hath been ſpoken to, will neglect an Ordinance of God, and be found blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy. <hi>God hath ordained, that thoſe that preach the Goſpel ſhould live of the Goſpel:</hi> but how ſhall they live, if they that are taught do not hand forth to them? Is it not to binde heavie burdens, and lay them on ſhoulders, that they that lay them on will not touch with one of their fingers? Is not this like
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118505:8"/>
               <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Egyptian bondage, command to make bricks, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low not ſtraw? If any do groan under the burden thereof, crying to the Lord, deliverance will be ſent: but thoſe will not have peace, that do not ſupply. Will not their gold and ſilver witneſs againſt them, who will not ſpare of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, notwithſtanding their brethrens wants, when there are thoſe that ſpend their ſtrength, and what they get, in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God? O that theſe things might take impreſſion upon the hearts of all thoſe that profeſs they love God. Although the Lord is angry with all idol-ſhepherds, that regard them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and not the flock, yet he will have all thoſe that teach his Word in truth, and do onely aim at his honour, and not at their own eaſe and profit, to be honoured, reſpected, and obeyed, ſo far as they ſpeak and walk in truth, according to the will and minde of God: and it is not the Lords minde any ſhould ſlight them, and ſpeak evil of them, as ſome do, for want of having their underſtandings opened. Look and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider for the proof of the laſt, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.12, 13. <hi>And we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you brethren to know them that labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admoniſh you; and to eſteem them very highly, in love, for their works ſake: and be at peace among your ſelves.</hi> 1 Tim. 5.17. <hi>Let the elders that rule well, be counted worthy of double honour, eſpecially they who labour in the word and doctrine.</hi> Heb. 13.7, 17. <hi>Remember them which have the rule over you, who have ſpoken to you the word of God; whoſe faith follow, conſidering the end of their converſation. Obey them that have the rule over you, and ſubmit your ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>There is one thing more you are to take heed of, how you receive an information againſt thoſe that are Elders: although they as well as other men are ſubject to many infirmities, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:118505:8"/>
do that which is not warrantable in the ſight of God, yet El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſhall ha e many a falſe aſperſion caſt on them undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly, to the end that they that do hearken to what truth they hold forth, may be diſcouraged to go on in the practiſe of any Ordinances of God. Conſider the rule, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Against an elder receive not an accuſation, but before two or three wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</hi> For thoſe that are inſtrumental in bringing honour to God, ſhall have many accuſers; as <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Miſtreſs accuſed him falſly and wrongfully, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.17. and <hi>Elijah,</hi> one that was ſaid to <hi>trouble Iſrael.</hi> You ſhall finde how men made Laws on purpoſe to entangle the innocent; as they did concerning <hi>Daniel,</hi> chap. 6. to verſ. 18. O what need have all thoſe that love God, to manifeſt love to ſuch that are ſo hated without cauſe, by thoſe that hate holineſs! ſeeing thoſe that hate holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and they that love righteouſneſs, are ſo few. Beſides all this, they ſhall meet with many abuſes amongſt falſe brethren. 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 18.17, 18. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo was ſaid to be <hi>a teacher of ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Abuſes amongſt falſe brethren, as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah.</hi> Without the great ſupport of God, thoſe that are Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters would be diſcouraged, and ready to faint, conſidering the wickedneſs of ſome amongſt them, notwithſtanding all that care and pains that is taken amongſt them, in reproving, inſtructing, admoniſhing, and labouring to bring them out of the ſnare of the devil, whereby they are taken by him at his will; as ſome following pride, covetouſneſs, drunkenneſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, and what not? ſuch that make a ſhew of godlineſs, for which the ſouls of true Watchmen do mourn in ſecret, and undergo heavie burdens, and few lay it to heart: but God will comfort them, in good time, when others aſhamed ſhall be. It is no new thing to be reproached. Chriſt the great Maſter of talents was reproached: for they ſaid he was <hi>a friend of Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canes and ſinners, a wine-bibber;</hi> and called his followers <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers.</hi> Jer. 18.18. <hi>Let us ſmite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words.</hi> But take notice how God dealt with ſuch, ſlighting <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſmiting one with a leproſie, and cauſing the earth to open its mouth, and ſwallow up thoſe that did rebel againſt him, <hi>Num.</hi> 16.32, 33. Some may ſay,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118505:9"/>
               <hi>Thoſe were wicked men, and God deſtroyed them for their rebellion againſt him, and no for their rebellion againſt Moſes.</hi> Minde <hi>Numb.</hi> 12. from verſ. 1. to 12. None ſhould ſpeak againſt thoſe, that with a ſingle heart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove men of ſin: nothing juſtly can be laid to their charge, yet revile. People ought not to rebuke an Elder, but intreat him as a father. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father.</hi> Others ought to be rebuked by him, as verſ. 20. of the ſame Chapter. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.20. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.13. Chap. 2 15. <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.8. No better rule to walk by, then the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, which are able to make the man of God wiſe to ſalvation. Let all make it their chiefeſt work, even their chiefeſt work, to ſearch the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, as opportunity is, that they may well underſtand this Treatiſe; and they will be counted <hi>noble</hi> in ſo doing, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.11. and in ſo doing, you may be able to minde thoſe that are Miniſters of their failings, when they fail, and alſo to caution them. <hi>Col.</hi> 4.17. <hi>And ſay to Archippus, Take heed to the miniſtery which thou hast received, in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.</hi> So that you may ſee, men are to be minded what their duties are, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe that are choſen and called to the Miniſtery, ſuch are men of failings, as well as others, to be minded leſt they ſhould diſhonour God in leading them a wrong way: and this may be laid to the peoples charge, as well as to the Miniſters. This will teach you not to give to Miniſters, except they preach the minde of God in the Word of Truth. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.17. Be not diſcouraged, when you ſee failings in thoſe that are Miniſters. Thoſe that are true Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, will take it kindly to be ſhewed their failings. A ſervant cannot do his work without where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to ſtrengthen him: how can others? The People coming ſhort of their duty, diſcourage the Miniſters in the performing of theirs.</p>
            <p>Wherefore doth the Lord intruſt a people with the talents of good things, but to be bountiful? And if not improved, God is ſo juſt, that he taketh away that he hath given, and giveth to them that will improve it, in his ſtrength, to his glory.</p>
            <p>Other duties are included, and not plainly expreſſed. As ſhepherds are to feed the flock, and to watch over it; then the flocks are to be at Aſſemblies appointed, to be fed there, and watched over; and not to be ſheep going, or rather gone aſtray. And this is not ſo conſidered, as it ought to be. Conſider that <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41, 42. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.25. In theſe things, let all, both Elders and People, look up to the Lord, to be bleſt, that they may ſo anſwer the righteous will of their God, that he may take pleaſure to dwell with them.
